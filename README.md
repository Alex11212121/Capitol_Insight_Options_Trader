# Capitol Insight Options Trader (CIOT) - README

## Overview
The Capitol Insight Options Trader (CIOT) repository serves as a preliminary showcase of the program currently under development. It provides a glimpse into the methodology and potential capabilities of the software. Please note, the code within this repository is intentionally incomplete and lacks several key elements. This is to ensure the proprietary aspects of the algorithm remain secure and unreplicable.

## Purpose
This repository is intended to provide an overview and insight into the CIOT's innovative approach to options trading. The primary objective is to demonstrate the concept and strategy underlying the CIOT without revealing the full extent of the proprietary technology and algorithms.

## How CIOT Works
1. **LDA Topic Extraction**: CIOT employs Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic extraction, analyzing the text of Congressional bills and relevant news articles. This process identifies the predominant themes and topics being discussed and considered in Congress.

2. **Cross-Referencing Congressional Boards and Committees**: The extracted topics are then cross-referenced with the boards and committees where Congress members sit. This step is crucial for understanding the potential impact and relevance of the topics in relation to specific stocks and sectors.

3. **Volatility Scoring**: Using the insights gained from the cross-referencing step, CIOT assigns a volatility score to stocks. This score is indicative of the potential impact of legislative activities and news on the stock's price movements.

4. **Straddle Options Trading Strategy**: If the volatility score surpasses a predefined threshold, CIOT executes a straddle options trading strategy. This strategy involves holding a position in both a call and a put with the same strike price and expiration date, capitalizing on expected significant volatility without committing to a direction.

## Disclaimer
The code in this repository is not a fully functional trading algorithm and should not be used as such. It is a conceptual and structural preview, missing critical proprietary components and security features. Users should view this code as a framework or template rather than a ready-to-use solution.

## Future Developments
We are continually refining and enhancing the Capitol Insight Options Trader. Future updates will focus on improving accuracy, efficiency, and security. We are committed to developing an advanced tool that helps users make informed and strategic trading decisions based on comprehensive legislative and news data analysis. 

Stay tuned for updates and official release announcements. Your feedback and inquiries are always welcome as we strive to create a robust and innovative trading tool.
