# Contributing to Tradium

As a small project, our contribution process is simple and informal. Here are the guidelines we follow:

## Quick Process
1. **Discuss changes**: Before starting to code, briefly discuss any significant changes. We can use Issues or direct messages for discussion.
2. **Code**: Implement your changes in your local copy of the project.
3. **Review**: Once you're done, create a pull request. The other person will review the changes, provide feedback, and merge them.

## Coding Standards
- We're following the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). Please ensure your code adheres to this style (to a resonable extent).
- Use descriptive commit messages that briefly explain your changes.

## Testing
- Test your code thoroughly before submitting a pull request.
- Update any relevant documentation with your changes.

## Communication
- For any significant changes or questions, let's discuss them before you begin coding.
- We're using Whatsapp for quick questions and updates.

## Keep it Simple
- As we're a small team, let's keep processes as simple and flexible as possible.
- If you feel any of these guidelines should be updated or changed, let's discuss it together.

Thank you for contributing!
